## Project Motivation
Imagine you are working for music streaming company like Spotify or Pandora called Sparkify.
Millions of users stream thier favorite songs everyday. 
Each user uses either the Free-tier with advertisement between the songs or the premium Subscription Plan.
Users can upgrade, downgrade or cancel thier service at any time.Hence, it's crucial to make sure that users love the service provided by Sparkify. 
Every time a users interacts with the Sparkify app data is generated. 
Events such as playing a song, logging out, like a song etc. are all recorded. 
All this data contains key insights that can help the business thrive. 
The goal of this project is then to analyse this data and predict which group of users are expected to churn - either downgrading from premium to free or cancel thier subscriptions altogether.

## Results
We have analysed the sparkify dataset and come up with new features to predict churn. 
We then created a machine learning model and tuned it to improve its performance.
We achieved an accuracy score of - and F1 score of - on the test dataset.

## Conclusion
We are able to achieve an accuracy score of 56 % with random forest and naive bayes
