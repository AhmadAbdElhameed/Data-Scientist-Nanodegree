# Data-Scientist-Nanodegree


**This repository contains the solutions to exercises and projects for Udacity's Data Scientist Nanodegree. It also contains links and bibliography that was collected while studying for the program.**

## Projects 
### 1. Data Science Blog Post
I selected the soccer database from Kaggle. It contains more than 25,000 matches and more than 10,000 players ,
 players and from several European countries from 2008 to 2016. By means of Exploratory Data Analysis method. 
Although we wonâ€™t be getting into the details of it for our example, the dataset even has attributes on weekly
 game updates, team line up, and detailed match events. The goal of this notebook is to walk you through an end
 to end process of analyzing a dataset . Our simple analytical process will include some steps for exploring 
and cleaning our dataset.

### 2. Disaster Response Pipeline Project
The goal of the project is to classify the disaster messages into categories. In this project, I analyzed disaster data from Figure Eight to build a model for an API that classifies disaster messages. Through a web app, the user can input a new message and get classification results in several categories. The web app also display visualizations of the data.

### 3. Recommendations with IBM
For this project we will analyze the interactions that users have with articles on the IBM Watson Studio platform, and make recommendations to them about new articles we think they will like. Below is an example of what the dashboard could look like displaying articles on the IBM Watson Platform. In order to determine which articles to show to each user, we will be performing a study of the data available on the IBM Watson Studio platform.

### 4. Data Scientist Capstone Project
#### sparkify-capstone-project
**This is the capstone project,as part of this one churn prediction system is built using pyspark.**
In this project, we will use PySpark to predict if a customer will cancel the subscription or not for a online music streaming company called Sparkify. This is a classification problem, as we will predict if a customer will churn or not. This is a pain area in all the areas now a days, IT, Healthcare, Infrastructure etc.
