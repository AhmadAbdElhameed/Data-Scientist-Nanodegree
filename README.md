## Projects 
### 1. Data Science Blog Post
I selected the soccer database from Kaggle. It contains more than 25,000 matches and more than 10,000 players ,
 players and from several European countries from 2008 to 2016. By means of Exploratory Data Analysis method. 
Although we won’t be getting into the details of it for our example, the dataset even has attributes on weekly
 game updates, team line up, and detailed match events. The goal of this notebook is to walk you through an end
 to end process of analyzing a dataset . Our simple analytical process will include some steps for exploring 
and cleaning our dataset.

### 2. Disaster Response Pipeline Project
The goal of the project is to classify the disaster messages into categories. In this project, I analyzed disaster data from Figure Eight to build a model for an API that classifies disaster messages. Through a web app, the user can input a new message and get classification results in several categories. The web app also display visualizations of the data.

### 3. Data Scientist Capstone Project
For the Capstone Project, I chose the “Optimizing App Offers With Starbucks” project, which basically trying to solve the problem on how to send the offer to the right customers. I did the analysis of the starbucks offers data and wrote the complete analysis in my Medium Blog Post, you can read it .
