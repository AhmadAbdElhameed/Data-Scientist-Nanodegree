**This repository contains the solutions to exercises and projects for Udacity's Data Scientist Nanodegree. It also contains links and bibliography that was collected while studying for the program.**

## Projects 
### 1. Data Science Blog Post
I selected the soccer database from Kaggle. It contains more than 25,000 matches and more than 10,000 players ,
 players and from several European countries from 2008 to 2016. By means of Exploratory Data Analysis method. 
Although we won’t be getting into the details of it for our example, the dataset even has attributes on weekly
 game updates, team line up, and detailed match events. The goal of this notebook is to walk you through an end
 to end process of analyzing a dataset . Our simple analytical process will include some steps for exploring 
and cleaning our dataset.

### 2. Disaster Response Pipeline Project
In this project, we are going to built a web app to do Machine Learning task, which is classifying a message. You can check the running web app in this link.

In order to run this project, you need the model (pickle file) and since the size is too big for github, you can download the pickle model in .

### 3. Data Scientist Capstone Project
For the Capstone Project, I chose the “Optimizing App Offers With Starbucks” project, which basically trying to solve the problem on how to send the offer to the right customers. I did the analysis of the starbucks offers data and wrote the complete analysis in my Medium Blog Post, you can read it .
